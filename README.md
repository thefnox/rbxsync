# rbxsync

Declaratively manage Roblox game passes, badges, and developer products from a single TOML config file.

rbxsync syncs your local configuration to Roblox, tracks remote state in a lockfile, detects icon changes with [BLAKE3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3) hashing, and generates a Luau module with all your asset IDs.

## Features

- **Declarative config** - Define all your passes, badges, and products in a single `rbxsync.toml`
- **Two-way sync** - Push local changes to Roblox or pull remote state to your config and lockfile
- **Icon management** - Upload icons, detect changes via BLAKE3 hashing, download remote icons
- **Conflict detection** - Detects when remote icons differ from local and lets you choose which to keep
- **Code generation** - Generates a Luau module (+ optional TypeScript definitions) mapping resource names to asset IDs
- **Flat & nested styles** - Choose between flat path-like keys or nested tables
- **Custom codegen paths** - Remap sections and individual items to custom paths
- **Extra entries** - Inject asset IDs for manually managed assets or other universes into the generated file
- **Alpha bleed** - Applies alpha bleeding to icons before uploading (enabled by default)
- **Duplicate detection** - Warns when multiple remote resources share the same name

## Installation

### Rokit

```sh
rokit add dev-bap/rbxsync
```

## Quick Start

### From an existing experience

```sh
rbxsync init --from-remote --universe-id 123456 --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

This fetches all your existing passes, badges, and products, downloads their icons, and generates both the config and lockfile. You can find your universe ID in the Creator Hub under your experience's URL.

### From scratch

```sh
rbxsync init
```

This creates a `rbxsync.toml` template. Edit it with your universe ID, creator info, and resources, then run:

```sh
rbxsync sync --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Commands

<details>
<summary><code>rbxsync init</code></summary>

Initialize a new config file.

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--from-remote` | Populate config from existing remote resources |
| `--universe-id` | Universe ID (required with `--from-remote`) |

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>rbxsync sync</code></summary>

Sync local config to Roblox. Creates, updates, and tracks resources.

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would change without applying |
| `--only` | Only sync specific types: `passes`, `badges`, `products` (comma-separated) |
| `--badge-cost` | Expected cost in Robux when creating a badge (default: `0`) |

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>rbxsync pull</code></summary>

Pull remote state into the config and lockfile.

Remote is the source of truth: remote-visible fields (`name`, `price`, `description`, etc.) are updated in the config while config-only fields (`icon`, `path`, `regional_pricing`) are preserved. New remote resources are added to the config.

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--dry-run` | Show what remote state differs without writing anything |
| `--accept-remote` | Download remote icons and update local files |
| `--accept-local` | Keep local icons and re-upload on next sync |

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>rbxsync check</code></summary>

Validate config, check lockfile consistency, and report if anything is out of sync.

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>rbxsync rename &lt;resource&gt; &lt;old_key&gt; &lt;new_key&gt;</code></summary>

Rename a resource key in both config and lockfile. The display name is preserved automatically.

```sh
rbxsync rename passes VIP vip_pass
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>rbxsync list &lt;resource&gt;</code></summary>

List remote resources. `resource` is one of: `passes`, `badges`, `products`.

</details>

## Configuration

rbxsync requires a `rbxsync.toml` file in the working directory (or specify with `--config`).

```toml
[experience]
universe_id = 123456789

[experience.creator]
type = "group"         # "user" or "group"
id = 123456

[codegen]
output = "src/shared/GameIds.luau"
# typescript = false   # Also generate a .d.ts file
# style = "flat"       # "flat" (default) or "nested"

[icons]
bleed = true           # Apply alpha bleed before uploading (default: true)
dir = "icons"          # Directory for downloaded icons (default: "icons")

[passes.VIP]
name = "VIP Pass"      # explicit display name on Roblox
price = 499
description = "VIP access to exclusive areas"
icon = "icons/vip.png"

[passes.Premium]       # name defaults to "Premium"
price = 999
description = "Premium membership"
icon = "icons/premium.png"

[badges.Welcome]       # name defaults to "Welcome"
description = "Welcome to the game!"
icon = "icons/welcome.png"
enabled = true

[products.Coins100]    # name defaults to "Coins100"
price = 99
description = "100 coins"
icon = "icons/coins.png"
```

### Extending a base config

A config can extend another file with `extends`. The extending file's values are
deep-merged on top of the base: tables merge key by key, scalars and arrays are
replaced. This makes per-environment configs trivial — define your passes,
badges, and products once, and point each environment at its own universe:

```toml
# rbxsync.base.toml — shared definitions (no universe)
[products.Coins100]
price = 99

# rbxsync.dev.toml
extends = "rbxsync.base.toml"

[experience]
universe_id = 111111111

[experience.creator]
type = "group"
id = 123456

# rbxsync.prod.toml
extends = "rbxsync.base.toml"

[experience]
universe_id = 222222222

[experience.creator]
type = "group"
id = 123456
```

```sh
rbxsync sync --config rbxsync.dev.toml
rbxsync sync --config rbxsync.prod.toml
```

The `extends` path is resolved relative to the file that declares it, and chains
are allowed (`a.toml` → `b.toml` → `c.toml`; cycles are an error). Each config
file gets its own lockfile named after it (`rbxsync.dev.toml` →
`rbxsync.dev.lock.toml`), so environments never clobber each other's state.

Commands that would rewrite the config (`pull`, `rename`) never write the merged
result back to disk when `extends` is involved — they update the lockfile and ask
you to edit the base or variant TOML yourself.

## Authentication

rbxsync uses the [Roblox Open Cloud API](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud/open-cloud). Create an API key at https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/credentials.

You can provide the key via the `--api-key` flag or the `RBXSYNC_API_KEY` environment variable:

```sh
rbxsync sync --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

```sh
export RBXSYNC_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
rbxsync sync
```

The `--api-key` flag takes precedence over the environment variable.

If a `.env` file exists in the working directory (or any parent), it is loaded
at startup, so `RBXSYNC_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY` in `.env` works too. Real
environment variables take precedence over `.env` entries.

### Required API scopes

| Resource | Scopes | Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Game Passes | `game-pass:read`, `game-pass:write` | [Game Passes API](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud/api/game-passes) |
| Developer Products | `developer-product:read`, `developer-product:write` | [Developer Products API](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud/api/developer-products) |
| Badges | `legacy-universe.badge:read`, `legacy-universe.badge:write`, `legacy-universe.badge:manage-and-spend-robux` | [Badges API](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud/api/badges), [Universes - Badges](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud/features/universes#badges) |
| Assets (icons) | `legacy-asset:manage` | [Assets](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud/features/assets#/) |

## Code Generation

When `codegen.output` is set, rbxsync generates a Luau module after every `sync`. The variable name is derived from the filename.

### Styles

#### Flat (default)

Items are stored with dot-separated path keys. This works well with TypeScript as the string-literal keys provide full autocomplete.

```toml
[codegen]
output = "src/shared/GameIds.luau"
style = "flat"
```

```lua
-- This file is auto-generated by rbxsync. Do not edit manually.

local GameIds = {
	["badges.Welcome"] = 98765,
	["passes.Premium"] = 67891,
	["passes.VIP"] = 67890,
	["products.Coins100"] = 11111,
}

return GameIds
```

Access: `GameIds["passes.VIP"]`

#### Nested

Items are organized into nested tables. Better for Luau since it provides direct table access without string keys.

```toml
[codegen]
output = "src/shared/GameIds.luau"
style = "nested"
```

```lua
-- This file is auto-generated by rbxsync. Do not edit manually.

local GameIds = {
	badges = {
		Welcome = 98765,
	},
	passes = {
		Premium = 67891,
		VIP = 67890,
	},
	products = {
		Coins100 = 11111,
	},
}

return GameIds
```

Access: `GameIds.passes.VIP`

### Custom paths

Use `[codegen.paths]` to remap entire sections, or per-item `path` to override individual items:

```toml
[codegen.paths]
passes = "gamepasses"
badges = "achievements"
products = "devproducts"

[products.special_offer]
price = 99
path = "shop.specials"       # overrides the section default
```

With `style = "nested"`, this produces:

```lua
local GameIds = {
	achievements = {
		Welcome = 98765,
	},
	gamepasses = {
		VIP = 67890,
	},
	devproducts = {
		Coins100 = 11111,
	},
	shop = {
		specials = {
			special_offer = 12345,
		},
	},
}
```

With `style = "flat"`:

```lua
local GameIds = {
	["achievements.Welcome"] = 98765,
	["gamepasses.VIP"] = 67890,
	["devproducts.Coins100"] = 11111,
	["shop.specials.special_offer"] = 12345,
}
```

### Extra entries

Inject asset IDs for manually managed assets or other universes into the generated file:

```toml
[codegen.extra]
"passes.legacy_vip" = 1234567
"products.starter_pack" = 9876543
```

These entries are merged alongside synced resources in the output. With `style = "flat"`:

```lua
local GameIds = {
	["passes.VIP"] = 67890,
	["passes.legacy_vip"] = 1234567,
	["products.Coins100"] = 11111,
	["products.starter_pack"] = 9876543,
}
```

### TypeScript

When `typescript = true`, a `.d.ts` file is generated alongside the Luau module:

```typescript
// This file is auto-generated by rbxsync. Do not edit manually.

declare const GameIds: {
	"badges.Welcome": number
	"passes.VIP": number
	"products.Coins100": number
}

export = GameIds
```

### Key escaping

Resource names that aren't valid Luau identifiers are automatically escaped:

```lua
["my-pass"] = 12345,
```

## Lockfile

rbxsync generates a lockfile that tracks remote state: asset IDs, icon hashes, and metadata. Commit this file to version control.

The lockfile is named after the config file: `rbxsync.toml` → `rbxsync.lock.toml`, `rbxsync.dev.toml` → `rbxsync.dev.lock.toml`. Each config (e.g. one per environment) keeps its own independent lockfile.

## Icon Conflict Resolution

When you run `pull` and a remote icon differs from what's in the lockfile:

```
! pass 'VIP': icon differs from remote
  Local:  icons/vip.png (blake3: a1b2c3d4e5f6...)
  Remote: asset 129268487446043
```

Resolve with:
- `--accept-remote` -- Downloads the remote icon to your local path
- `--accept-local` -- Keeps your local icon and re-uploads it on next `sync`
